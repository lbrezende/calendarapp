The calendar should display all the dates for the current month. The calendar app should also be able to mark appointments. The app must have the following functionality:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any appointment can be made for the current day or for a future date.</li>
	<li>No two appointments should overlap. If an&nbsp;appointment already&nbsp;exists for a day, a warning should be shown.</li>
	<li>Appointments can be edited and deleted.</li>
</ul>
